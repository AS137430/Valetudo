        Do you believe that that is actually broken as in "Not behaving as it was obviously intended to behave",
        or is it just not as expected as in "I've expected it to do X but it did do Y instead"?

        - Broken
        - Not as expected

        What would be the correct behavior?<br/>
        If you've previously selected "Not as expected", why did you expect that? Is it reasonable to expect that?

        Since Valetudo is not a custom firmware but just a cloud replacement running on the robot,
        are you sure that the issue you're seeing relates to **the code of Valetudo** and not the vendor firmware?

        - Certainly Valetudo-related
        - Probably Valetudo-related
        - Might be Valetudo-related
        - Could be Valetudo-related
        - Probably not Valetudo-related
        - Certainly not Valetudo-related
